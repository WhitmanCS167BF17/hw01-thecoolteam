= Homework 1: In the Beginning was the Command Line =

5 points

== 1. Goals ==
The goal of this homework is to get you used to using the computers
here in the labs, and getting started with one of our main tools.

== 2. Setup and Requirements ==
While you may be able to work on homework assignments on your personal
computers, it's worth while to learn how to use the lab computers and
the tools on them. You'll need to be able to log in to the computers 
in Olin 124. If you are having trouble with logging in, contact 
Dustin Palmer.

== 3. Your Task ==
=== What is a ``Command Line''? ===
We will be using a particular
tool on these computers that you may not be familiar with, known as the 
``Command Line''.

In the olden days of computing, (around 1960 - 1970,) there weren't fancy
displays. Most computer monitors were only capable of extremely simple graphics,
and generally they were restricted to displaying only alphanumeric characters,
80 columns by 25 lines. 

Therefore, the entire interaction was by typing the names of commands into
this window, then pressing ``Return'' to begin the command. Imagine that 
every time you wanted to run Firefox, you had to type ``Firefox'' and press
enter. That's how it all worked. (Of course, there wouldn't have been any 
program with graphics as fancy as Firefox, but that's beside the point.)

It may sound terrible, but it was (and still is) an essential tool for a
programmer. Although it may be hard to believe, there are certain interactions
that are much easier in a command line interface than with the Mouse-and-Graphics 
interface that you are used to.

In fact, if you're interested about the history of the early days of computer interaction, 
and the first 30 years of operating system evolution, you can download and read an entertaining 
version titled

(This is in no way required for this assignment or the course, it's simply interesting
and funny.)

To learn the command line, log in to one of the lab machines in Olin 124. 

Once you have logged in, run the Application *Terminal*. (It should have a shortcut in
the dock.) This will open up small 
window that displays text characters (specifically, it is 80 columns by 25 lines.)
In the window you'll see something like this:
----
exleyas@holberton:~$ 
----
Voila! This is your command line. The line of text there is known as the 
*prompt*. There is actually a lot of information in that 
cryptic line: It is telling you your username (in my case, +exleyas+,) your computer name 
(+holberton+,) and your current directory (+~+, which is a special name for the current 
user's home directory.) 

Now, go through _Typograhical Conventions_, _Introduction to
the UNIX Operating System_, and _Tutorials 1-4_ of this
link:http://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/jondich/documents/unixtutorial/[tutorial].
The tutorial was originally written for the Unix operating system and for
students at the University of Surrey (note British spellings,) but it is still
accurate enough for us.

One difference is that on their system, the final character of the prompt is a +%+,
but on our systems it is a +$+. So all their examples of what to type begin with a +%+
character. Don't type this in to the command line. It is simply an indicator of 
what the prompt looks like.

== 4. Submission ==
This assignment may be submitted late and still counted as on time if you were not able 
to enroll in the class until after the due date.

Submit the *biglist* file that you created in tutorial 3.

Use the homework submission tool linked to from the course web site.
